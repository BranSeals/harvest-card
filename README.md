Harvest Card Game
=================

About
-----
Harvest Card Game (working title) is a CLI version of a Harvest Moon-style card game I am developing for commercial release. It is meant for prototyping the physical card game, but is also being written as a final project for class, and will be further developed into a full-fledged video game.

My name is Bran Seals and I am a second year Computer Science student based in Bloomington, Indiana. I'm still very much new to programming, so I don't mind receiving input, advice, criticism, or other forms of help, as anything would go a long way for me. Currently, I write code in a vacuum with no feedback, so the only metric I have is if my code works or not. If you have feedback or just want to say hello, you can email me at brandon.seals@gmail.com.
